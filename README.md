# Heart-Disease-Analysis

# Context

    This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.
    It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease
  
 # Content
 
 1.) Data insight: As mentioned here we will be working with the heart disease detection dataset and we will be putting out interesting inferences from the data       to derive some meaningful results.
 
2.) EDA: Exploratory data analysis is the key step for getting meaningful results.

3.) Feature Engineering: After getting the insights from the data we have to alter the features so that they can move forward for the model building phase.


# Conclusion

    Data Visualization and Data Analysis of the target variable, age features, and whatnot along with its univariate analysis and bivariate analysis.and 
    Feature engineering by plotting continuous and categorical variables.
